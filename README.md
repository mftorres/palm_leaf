Abstract
-------------

Leaves display a remarkable variety of shapes, but in many cases it is unknown if this variation is primarily driven by phylogenetic variation or environmental selection. It has been suggested that leaf shape has a long-term adaptive role and represents a strategy for success in the face of environmental changes. Here, we explore the contribution of biotic and abiotic factors to the evolution of leaf shape in a plant lineage with one of the highest diversities of leaf shape known, the palms (family Arecaceae). We apply a phylogenetic comparative framework to test for correlations between climate, soil features, and plant morphology. We find that plant size and annual seasonality in climate have a positive effect on leaf dissection. Using multistate speciation and extinction models, we reconstruct the ancestral state of palm leaves to be entire, with recent transitions into polymorphic and pinnate shapes. As the global temperatures cooled through time, the relative frequency of pinnate lineages increased and the frequency of entire lineages decreased. Our results suggest that dissected leaves are only possible for large species with enough structural support to support the leaf and that dissection facilitated the expansion of palm lineages into seasonal areas outside of the tropics.

The code here is under constant updates and will be (one would hope) annotated and simplified as much as possible.
