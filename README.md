This repository stores python code associated with the project:

Predictors of palm leaf shape: climate, morphology, and phylogeny. My contribution as leader of this project includes data analyses,
scripting, figures and manuscript writing.

Collaborators: **Torres, MF** , Chazot, N, Faurby, S, Emilio, T, Antonelli, A, Bacon, CD.

The code here is under constant updates and will be (one would hope) annotated and simplified as much as possible.
